# Approximation Assignment

## Exploring Aliasing and the Sampling Theorem
Illustrate the effects of sampling and aliasing:

* Generate a continuous-time signal.
* Sample it at various rates (above and below the Nyquist rate).
* Apply the Fourier Transform to analyze the sampled signal.
* Visualize aliasing and proper reconstruction techniques.


## How to use:
Run the sampling_aliasing.py script. Modify the frequency and sampling_frequency parameters at the beginning of the script to change the frequency of the continuous time signal and the frequency at which the continuous signal is sampled. When calling the functions, set plot = True for visualizations.
