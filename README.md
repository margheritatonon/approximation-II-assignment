# Approximation Assignment

## Exploring Aliasing and the Sampling Theorem
Illustrate the effects of sampling and aliasing:

• Generate a continuous-time signal.
• Sample it at various rates (above and below the Nyquist rate).
• Apply the Fourier Transform to analyze the sampled signal.
• Visualize aliasing and proper reconstruction techni
