\section{Introduction}
In signal processing, \dots %introduction sentence

An analog signal refers to a signal that varies continuously over time. The complexity of analog signal processing, along with their susceptibility to noise and signal degradation over time as well as their limited reproductibility and scalability, makes them inconvenient to work with in practice. 
Therefore, digital signals are used -- signals that vary discretely over time and can take only a finite number of distinct values.

Sampling refers to the process of converting an analog signal into a digital signal. If we let $x(t)$ be a continuous time signal, the sampled signal $x[n]$ is defined as
\begin{center}
    \begin{math}
        x[n] = x(nT_s)
    \end{math}  
\end{center}
where $n$ represents, and $T_s$ represents.

%some context into the problem, theory
%overview of what sampling is, why its used!! important to say why sampling
%what happens when we sample?
%the problem of reconstruction and the need for sufficiently high sampling frequencies

\section{Implementation}
%explanation of code, and I think here you would explain things like the theory behind the sinc function


\section{Discussion}
%results of code
%different initial frequencies, different sampling frequencies based on shannon nyquist thm

\section{Conclusion}
