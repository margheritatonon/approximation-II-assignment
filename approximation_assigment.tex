\maketitle

\section{Introduction}
In signal processing, 
%some context into the problem, theory
%overview of what sampling is, why its used!! important to say why sampling
%what happens when we sample?
%the problem of reconstruction and the need for sufficiently high sampling frequencies

\section{Implementation}
%explanation of code, and I think here you would explain things like the theory behind the sinc function


\section{Discussion}
%results of code
%different initial frequencies, different sampling frequencies based on shannon nyquist thm

\section{Conclusion}
